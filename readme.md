# Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

<h2>Overview:</h2>
This mini project focuses on implementing an Emotion Detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify the emotions present in a given input, such as text, audio, or images.
<br>

<h2>Features:</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Text Emotion Detection:</b> The model can analyze and classify emotions from textual input.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies and Tools:</h2>
Machine Learning Frameworks: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, will be used to develop and train the machine learning models.

<h3>Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Train and fine-tune machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection across different input types.
</li>
<li>
Optimize the models for speed and efficiency to allow real-time or near real-time emotion detection.
</li>
<li>
Encourage collaboration and contributions from the open-source community to enhance the accuracy and capabilities of the emotion detection system.
</li>
</ul>
